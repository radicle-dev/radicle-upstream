# Workflow

Our current workflow is to put our changes in feature branches which get
submitted for review on GitHub as pull requests. Ideally a pull request is
small and changes only one aspect of the code at a time. After a pull request
is reviewed by at least one peer and passes all tests, it can be squash-merged
into master.

To automate our release process as much as possible we're using
[Standard Version][sv] and commits on master should be formatted according to
the [conventional commits specification][ccs].

Here are a couple of examples:
```
  chore: remove leftover error mod reference (#74)
  fix: improve project creation validations (#76)
  feat: project creation (#70)
```

The pull request ref goes in brackets at the end of the subject.
Generally we also follow [good commit message hygene][tpope].


## Work coordination

Work on the app and proxy can happen in parallel. However for this to work the
teams working on both code bases have to agree on a common API. The definitive
source-of-truth for this API is the proxy source code.

To change or extend the API, first open an issue on GitHub, discuss what is
needed and then propose proxy code changes that implement the API.

We don't keep around a copy of an SDL schema file as they tend to get outdated
quickly and it is way easier to explore the API via introspection. See the next
section for more information on that.


### GraphiQL explorer

The introspective and self-docummenting nature of GraphQL allows us to easily
explore our API by querying the backend. For better developer ergonomics we
include a [static version][gs] of [GraphiQL-explorer][ge]. To see it in action:

1. Start the app in development mode: `cd app && yarn start`
2. Launch GraphiQL from a separate shell: `yarn graphiql`
   or directly navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

You can see all the possible queries and their parameters by opening the
GraphiQL explorer sidebar, for that simply click the `Explorer` button. More
extensive API documentation is provided in the `Docs` sidebar. You can navigate
through all the queries and types by clicking on them.

Annotations for queries, mutations, types and fields also get propagated from
the proxy source into the `Docs` section.


## Releases

To perform a release:

1. If you haven't already, install the [`hub`][hub] cli tool.

2. Run: `cd app && yarn release` and follow the instructions.
   Here's what a typical release looks like:

```sh
$ yarn release

Cutting release v0.0.11:

  ✔ git checkout master
  ✔ git branch release-v0.0.11 && git checkout release-v0.0.11
  ✔ yarn run standard-version
  ✔ git push origin release-v0.0.11
  ✔ hub pull-request -p --no-edit

Now ask a peer to review the following pull request,
but don't merge it just yet:

  👉 https://github.com/rudolfs/test/pull/17

To merge the pull request and finalize this release run:

  👉 yarn release:finalize v0.0.11 17


$ yarn release:finalize v0.0.11 17

Finalizing release v0.0.11:

  ✔ hub api -XPUT "repos/radicle-dev/radicle-upstream/pulls/17/merge"
  ✔ git checkout master && git pull
  ✔ git tag v0.0.11 74369ee3c078bc3688f0b668cc94a36491271d52
  ✔ git push --tags

Release v0.0.11 successfully completed! 👏 🎉 🚀
```

3. Once the release PR branch is merged into master a build will be triggered
   on Buildkite, this will build the app for both Linux and macOS. When the
   build has completed you can download the binaries [here][artifacts].


## CI setup

CI is configured via:

```sh
radicle-upstream/.buildkite
.
├── Dockerfile
├── pipeline.yaml
└── run.sh
```

The build process is run for every commit that is pushed to GitHub. When the
tests pass, the build process spits out and uploads an app binary as a build
artifact. When the tests fail, screenshots of the failing tests will be
uploaded instead of the binary.


### Docker image updates

We use a Docker image that has all of the system dependencies installed to run
tests on Buildkite. Follow these steps if you need to update the dependencies
bundled in the image:

1. Install [Google Cloud SDK][gc].

2. Authenticate with Google Cloud: `gcloud auth configure-docker`, pick
   `[1] opensourcecoin` when asked for which project to use.

3. Prepare a new docker image with all the necessary dependencies by editing:
   `.buildkite/Dockerfile`.

4. Get the current image version from `pipeline.yaml` and build a new Docker
   image (remember to bump the version):
```sh
cd .buildkite
docker build . -t gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1
docker push gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1
```

5. Push the new image version to Google Cloud:
   `docker push gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1`

6. Update the image version in `pipeline.yaml`:
```yaml
DOCKER_IMAGE: 'gcr.io/opensourcecoin/radicle-upstream:0.2.1'
```

7. Commit changes to `Dockerfile` and `pipeline.yaml` and push to origin, this
   should build the new branch with the updated image.
